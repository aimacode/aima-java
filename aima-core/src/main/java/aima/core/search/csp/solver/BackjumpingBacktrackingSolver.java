/**
 * Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.): Section 6.3, Page 223.<br>
 * A more intelligent approach to backtracking is to backtrack to a variable that might fix the problem â€” a variable
 * that was responsible for making one of the possible values of SA impossible. To do this, we will keep track of
 * a set of assignments that are in conflict with some value for SA. The set (in this case {Q=red, NSW=green, V=blue,}),
 * is called the conflict set for SA. The backjumping method backtracks to the most recent assignment in
 * the conflict set; in this case, backjumping would jump over Tasmania and try a new value for V. This method
 * is easily implemented by a modification to BACK TRACK such that it accumulates the conflict set while checking
 * for a legal value to assign. If no legal value is found, the algorithm should return the most recent element of
 * the conflict set along with the failure indicator.<br>
 *
 * In this implementation, backtrack returns the whole set of variables causing the dead-end instead of just the most
 * recent element. The set of variables involved in a conflict set is called nogood here.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * Only one nogood is tracked at a time thought there could be more of them
 * (e.g. resulting from two unsatisfied constraints).
 * Inferences like forward checking or constraint propagation are not supported.
 *
 * @param <VAR> Type which is used to represent variables
 * @param <VAL> Type which is used to represent the values in the domains
