# AIMA-CORE

### Requirements
JDK 1.8 - is the baseline JDK against which this project is developed.

### Current Release: 3.0.0-Search-Improvements (outdated)
#### 3.0.0-Search-Improvements : Dec 18 2016
* Releasing as a full version number, corresponding to 3rd edition of book 
  (i.e. all 3rd edition releases will start with 3.x.x going forward).
 
## Details

### Build Instructions
If you just want to use the classes, all you need to do is put the aima-core.jar on your CLASSPATH.

If you want to rebuild from the source, run the unit tests etc.., follow these instructions:

To build from the command line:
* Ensure you have JDK 1.8+ installed.
* Ensure you have [ant](http://ant.apache.org/) installed.
* Download the release archive.
* Unzip
* Go to the aima-core directory
* Type 'ant'. This will generate a build directory, which will include the following sub-directories:
  * bin/ will contain all the main and test Java classes.
  * doc/ will contain generated JavaDoc for the project.
  * release/ will contain a jar file of all the core algorithms.

Note: Many IDE's have built in ant versions. So you may want to try that first. 
Included in the aima-core directory are .classpath and .project files for the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) IDE.

## Using the Code

For examples of how to use the various algorithms and supporting classes, look at the test cases in the parallel directory structure under src/test or in the demo package of the aima-gui sub-project. General comments on architecture and design can be found in [Wiki0](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/wiki/AIMA3e-Architecture-and-Design).

### Notes on the Agent Framework
For comments on the design of the agent framework, see [Wiki1](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/wiki/AIMA3e-Agent-Framework).

### Notes on Search

To define a problem for search you can follow this steps:
* Choose or implement a class to represent states and another to represent
  actions for navigation through the state space. Often, `String`/ `Integer`
  and `DynamicAction` will do. For the N-Queens-Problem,
  `aima.core.environment.nqueens.NQueensBoard` and
  `aima.core.environment.nqueens.QueenAction` are suitable. Most of the framework
  classes are generic. Their type parameters `S` and `A` should always be bound to
  the classes chosen in this step.
* Provide the functions needed to define the problem. Methods can be used as well
  as nested classes or lambda expressions.
  Class `aima.core.environment.nqueens.NQueensFunctions` contains some example
  implementations, e.g.
  ```java
  public static boolean testGoal(NQueensBoard state) {
     return state.getNumberOfQueensOnBoard() == state.getSize() && state.getNumberOfAttackingPairs() == 0;
  }
  ```
  If you need to do an informed search, you should create a heuristic function
  which implements the `ToDoubleFunction<Node<S, A>>` interface.
* Implement `aima.core.search.framework.problem.Problem` directly using the functional material from the previous step
  or use/extend `aima.core.search.framework.problem.GeneralProblem` to create an instance of the problem to be solved.
  `GeneralProblem` accepts an initial state, an actions function, a result function, a goal test, and a
  step-cost function as constructor arguments.
  ```java
  public static Problem<NQueensBoard, QueenAction> createIncrementalFormulationProblem(int boardSize) {
      return new GeneralProblem<>(new NQueensBoard(boardSize), NQueensFunctions::getIFActions,
          NQueensFunctions::getResult, NQueensFunctions::testGoal, (s, a, sPrimed) -> 1.0);
  }
  ```
That is all you need to do (unless you plan to write a different search than is available in the code base).

To actually search you need to:
* Configure a problem instance (see above).
* Select a search strategy. Configure this with some `QueueSearch` (e.g. `TreeSearch` or `GraphSearch`) if applicable.
* Call methods `findActions` or `findState` directly or instantiate a `SearchAgent`.
* Print any actions and metrics.

A good example (from the NQueens Demo) is:
```java
private static void solveNQueensWithBreadthFirstSearch() {
    System.out.println("\n--- NQueensDemo BFS ---");

    Problem<NQueensBoard, QueenAction> problem = NQueensFunctions.createIncrementalFormulationProblem(boardSize);
    SearchForActions<NQueensBoard, QueenAction> search = new BreadthFirstSearch<>(new GraphSearch<>());
    Optional<List<QueenAction>> actions = search.findActions(problem);

    actions.ifPresent(qActions -> qActions.forEach(System.out::println));
    System.out.println(search.getMetrics());
}
```
For further information about code design, see [Wiki2](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/wiki/AIMA3e-Search-Framework).
An overview of the CSP package is given in [Wiki3](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/wiki/AIMA3e-CSP-Package).

### Logic Notes
To use First Order Logic, first you need to create an instance of `aima.core.logic.fol.domain.FOLDomain`
which collects the FOL Constants, Prredicates, and Function etc... that you use to solve a particular problem.

A parser (that understands the Grammar in figure 8.3 (page 293 of AIMA3e) needs to be instantiated with this domain, e.g:
 
    FOLDomain weaponsDomain = DomainFactory.weaponsDomain();
    FOLParser parser = new FOLParser(weaponsDomain);

the basic design of all the logic code is that the parser creates a Composite (Design Patterns by Gamma, et al) parse tree over which various Visitors (Design Patterns by Gamma, et al) traverse. The key difference between the Visitor elucidated in the GOF book and the code is that in the former the visit() methods have a void visit(ConcreteNode) signature while the visitors used in the logic code have a Object visit(ConcreteNode,Object arg) signature. This makes testing easier and allows some recursive code that is hard with the former .


### Probability Notes

I have tried to make the code stick very closely to Dr. Norvig's pseudo-code. Looking at the tests will reveal how to use the code. 


### LearningNotes

#### Main Classes and responsibilities
A <DataSet> is a collection of <Example>s. Wherever you see "examples" in plural in the text, the code uses a DataSet. This makes it easy to aggregate operations that work on collections of examples in one place.

An Example is a collection of Attributes. Each example is a data point for Supervised Learning.

DataSetSpecification and AttributeSpecification do some error checking on the attributes when they are read in from a file or string. At present there are two types of Attributes - A sring attribute, used for datasets like "restaurant" and a Numeric Attribute, which represents attributes which are numbers. These are presently modeled as Doubles.

A Numerizer specifies how a particular DataSet's examples may be converted to Lists of Doubles so they can be used in Neural Networks. There is presently one numerizer in the codebase (IrisDataSetNumerizer) but it is trivial to write more by implementing the Numerizer interface.

#### How to Apply Learners

The DecisionTreeLearner and DecisionListLearner work only on datasets with ordinal attributes (no numbers). Numbers are treated as distinct strings.

The Perceptron and DecisionTreeLearners work on *numerized datasets*. If you intend to work with these, you need to write a DataSetSpecific Numerizer by implementing the Numerizer interface.

1. To import a dataset into a system so that learners can be applied to it, first add a public static DataSet getXDataSet(where "x" is the name of the DataSet you want to import) to the DataSetFactory

2. Learners all implement the Learner interface with 3 methods, train, predict and test. If you want to add a new type of Learner (a partitioning Decision Tree learner perhaps?) you need to implement this interface.
