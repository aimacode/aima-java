<p>The <code>aimax.osm</code> package together with its sub-packages contain a
    tool for reading, maintaining, and viewing Open Street Map (OSM) data. Two GUIs are provided:
    One based on JavaFX (package <code>aimax.osm.gui.fx</code>) and the other based on
    Swing (package <code>aimax.osm.gui.swing</code>).
    The viewer is designed as an efficient general purpose viewer which is highly configurable and
    extendable. The internal map representation is chosen as close as possible to the
    original OSM XML file format. A kd-tree is used to improve rendering efficiency.
    Classification and abstraction of map entities as well as their
    visual appearance within the drawn map are controlled by declarative
    rendering rules. They can be replaced or configured at runtime.
    New personal map styles can be created quite easily. See classes
    <code>aimax.osm.viewer.MapStyleFactory</code> and
    <code>aimax.osm.gui.swing.applications.OsmViewerPlusApp</code> for ideas how that can be
    achieved.

<p>Routing functionality is based on the AIMA-JAVA core library.
    All dependencies to the core library are encapsulated in the routing
    sub-package and the applications using functionality from that package.
    So the viewer classes can also be used as stand-alone library
    for building general OSM applications.</p>

<p> In the current version, relation entities are ignored and
    the size of the map should be limited to about a million nodes
    to avoid long loading times. The tool Osmosis can be used to generate
    maps complying to this requirement.</p>

<p> Getting started: Compile the project and run one of the applications
    in the <code>aimax.osm.gui.fx.applications</code> package. If no map is displayed
    by default, make sure that the main/resource folder is included in
    the build path of your project, recompile and start again.
    Then place the mouse inside the map viewer pane. Try mouse-left, mouse-middle, mouse-right,
    mouse-drag, ctrl-mouse-left, plus button, minus button, ctrl-plus, ctrl-minus,
    space, ctrl-space, arrow buttons, and also the mouse-wheel for navigation,
    mark setting, and track definition. Before routing, at least two markers
    must be set!</p>
