/**
 * This package provides useful base classes for building graphical agent
 * applications. The design is inspired by the model-view-controller pattern.
 * An <code>Environment</code> serves as model, the <code>AgentAppFrame</code>
 * together with its embedded <code>AgentAppEnvironmentView</code> as view,
 * and the <code>AgentAppController</code> as controller.
 * The <code>SimpleAgentApp</code> application demonstrates, how this parts
 * can be plugged together.
