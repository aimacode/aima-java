<p>This package contains a simple reader for XML files using the
OSM syntax. To use it, just take a look at class <code>OsmReader</code>.
The architecture relies on the application of the state
design pattern (GoF). All element processors can be viewed as states
in this sense.</p> 
<p>The SAX-parser is a strongly simplified version of the Osmosis OSM
file parser, written by Brett Henderson. Many parts of the code remained
almost unchanged. Some refactoring was done to reduce the number of
classes needed and to improve speed by focusing on the relevant
data.</p>
