    "# Probabilistic Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the supporting material for chapter 14**Probabilistic Reasoning**. In this notebook, we will learn how to use the code respository to build network models to reason under uncertainty according to the laws of probability theory. In the previous notebook, we briefly explained what Bayes' Rule is and how it can be utilised in Probabilistic Inference. This notebook introduces a systematic way to represent such conditional relationships in the form of **Bayesian Networks**. We will also have a look at a variety of approximate inference algorithms and will also explore ways in which probability theory can be applied to worlds with objects and relations(worlds represented in first order logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing knowledge in an uncertain domain\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous notebooks that the full joint probability distribution models can answer any question about the domain but they are computationally expensive as the space complexity grows exponentially. However, we saw that independence and conditional independence relationships among variables can be of great help in defining a full joint distribution. Owing to these shortcomings of full joint distributions and to the merits of conditional relations between random variables, AI researchers have come up with a clever data structure called Bayesian Networks. Bayesian networks can represent essentially any full joint probability distribution and in many cases can do so very concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bayesian network is a directed graph in which each node is annotated with quantitative probability information. The full specification is as follows:\n",
    "* Each node corresponds to a random variable, which may be discrete or continuous.\n",
    "* A set of directed links or arrows connects pairs of nodes. If there is an arrow from node X to node Y , X is said to be a parent of Y. The graph has no directed cycles (and hence is a directed acyclic graph, or DAG).\n",
    "* Each node $X_i$ has a conditional probability distribution $P(X_i \\mid Parents(X_i ))$ that quantifies the effect of the parents on the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topology of the network—the set of nodes and links—specifies the conditional independence relationships that hold in the domain. The\n",
    "intuitive meaning of an arrow is typically that X has a direct influence on Y, which suggests\n",
    "that causes should be parents of effects. It is usually easy for a domain expert to decide what\n",
    "direct influences exist in the domain—much easier, in fact, than actually specifying the probabilities themselves. Once the topology of the Bayesian network is laid out, we need only\n",
    "specify a conditional probability distribution for each variable, given its parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian Networks possess many interesting properties which are quite brilliantly explained in the text. Readers are advised to go through the text to get a feel for the Bayesian Networks. In this notebook, our main focus will be to utilise Bayesian Networks to model various problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with the Bayesian Networks let us first load the aima jar."
